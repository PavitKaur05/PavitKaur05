### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Pavit

Hola! My name is Pavit Kaur(She/her)  
I am a final year Undergraduate student pursuing Bachelors of Computer Science and Engineering in India and I am currently **Google Summer of Code Student Developer with Debian**.

Now, as you are here then I am assuming that it would be because you want to know about me :grin: so let's talk more about me!

I have keen interest in building and working with APIs and databases :heart:, so I am always looking for opportunities to work on Backend Development section of projects (let me know if you have one for me :innocent:) . I have some Backend Development experience in buildng APIs using Django REST (Python), Node.js(Javascript) and Sinatra(Ruby) integrated with databases such as PostgreSQL and MongoDB.
