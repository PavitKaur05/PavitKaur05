### Hi there üëã, I'm Pavit

My name is Pavit Kaur(She/her)  
I am part of the engineering team at [**HackerRank**](https://www.hackerrank.com/). I contributed to Debian as a student developer through [**Google Summer of Code 2021**](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2021/projects/6267095049830400).

üöÄ **Backend Developer**

I love working with **APIs, databases, and scalable backend systems** ‚ù§Ô∏è. Experienced in building backend services using **Python, Ruby, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Golang**, with frameworks like **Django REST Framework, Ruby on Rails, Nest.js, and Sinatra**.  

Comfortable with **PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, and Elasticsearch**, and familiar with cloud platforms like **AWS (Lambda, DynamoDB, SQS)**.  

Always exploring better ways to design and optimize backend systems.
